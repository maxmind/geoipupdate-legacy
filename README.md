## Installing on Ubuntu

MaxMind provides a PPA for recent version of Ubuntu. To add the PPA to your
sources, run:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maxmind/ppa

Then install `geoipupdate` by running:

    $ sudo aptitude update
    $ sudo aptitude install geoipupdate

## Installing From Source File

To install this from the source package, you will need a C compiler, Make,
the zlib library and headers, and the curl library and headers.

On Debian or Ubuntu, you can install these
dependencies by running:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev

On Centos 7 or RHEL 7, you can install these
dependencies by running:

    $ sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
    $ sudo yum install libcurl-devel

Once you have the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The `configure` script takes the standard options to set where files are
installed such as `--prefix`, etc. See `./configure --help` for details.
